## Description
Aim assist (aim hack) for the FPS(first person shoorter) game Overwatch.
Captures screen realtime to search for enemy position. Then moves the mouse position until the crosshair alligns with the enemy.
Only tested on a video capture of the gameplay as it is illegal to use aim hacks within the game.

## Result
Works as intended in replays (videos) of Overwatch gameplay.
Optimizations could be made in mouse cursor movement by continuously tracking the enemy instead of suddenly teleporting to enemy position.

## Demo
[Demo Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW9D8C3hcD0&ab_channel=AnonN)
The mouse cursor follows where the enemy is located
