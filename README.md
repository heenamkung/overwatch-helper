## Description
Aim assist program for the game Overwatch.
Captures screen realtime to search for enemy position. Then moves the mouse position until the crosshair alligns with the enemy. 

## Result
Works as intended in replays (videos) of Overwatch gameplay
Does not work on actual gameplay: soon after the game detects unusual mouse inputs, all screen capture returns a black screen.
